# Model Calibration

Open-PAV provides tools for calibrating various vehicle kinematic models:

## Supported Models

- **Linear Models**: Suitable for basic simulations.
- **IDM Models**: Ideal for SUMO simulations.
- **Wiedemann-99**: Compatible with Vissim.
- **Machine Learning-Based Models**: For advanced simulations.

## Calibration Steps

1. **Data Input**: Load your collected data into the calibration tool.
2. **Parameter Adjustment**: Adjust model parameters to fit the data.
3. **Validation**: Validate the calibrated model against a test dataset.
4. **Export**: Export the calibrated parameters for simulation use.

For detailed calibration procedures, refer to the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md).
