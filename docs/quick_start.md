# Quick Start

Get started with Open-PAV by following these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure Open-PAV is installed on your system. Refer to the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for instructions.

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your datasets (LiDAR, images, videos, trajectories) and place them in the appropriate directories.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose the desired vehicle model (e.g., Tesla, Audi, Benz) and the corresponding kinematic model (e.g., IDM, linear model, machine learning model).

4. **Model Calibration**: Use the provided tools to calibrate the selected model with your data.

5. **Simulation Integration**: Export the calibrated model parameters and integrate them into your preferred simulation platform (e.g., SUMO, Vissim).

For more detailed instructions, consult the [User Guide](user_guide.md).
