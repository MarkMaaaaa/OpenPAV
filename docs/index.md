# Open-PAV

Open-PAV (Open Product Automated Vehicle) is an open platform designed to facilitate data collection, model calibration, and simulation of producted automated vehicle behaviors. It integrates diverse datasets and calibrated vehicle models, making it an essential tool for researchers and developers aiming to study product automated vehicle (PAV) dynamics and their impacts. The project encourages contributions from the research community and provides ready-to-use model parameters for seamless integration with simulation tools.

## Key Features

**Comprehensive Data Repository**

- Collects and organizes data from PAVs, including LiDAR, images, videos, and trajectory data (We have summarized 14 AV brands, 33 AV models in 13 Open-source AV Datasets from 6 AV Data Providers, [Dataset Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03795-y)).

- Provides datasets in a unified vectorized format for efficient access and analysis.

**AV Model Calibration**

- Supports linear models, IDM models (for SUMO), Wiedemann-99 (for Vissim), and machine learning-based models.
- Includes pre-configured model parameters for direct use in traditional simulation software.

**Multiple Simulator Integrations**

- Enables rapid and accurate simulation of automated vehicle behavior and analysis of their impacts.

**Community Collaboration**

- Designed to foster contributions and collaboration among researchers globally.
