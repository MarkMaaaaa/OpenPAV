# OpenPAV
The Open-PAV project collects and organizes data from commercial automated vehicles, including LiDAR, images, videos, and trajectory data, in a unified vectorized format. It provides calibrated kinematic models (linear, IDM, Wiedemann-99, ML-based) with pre-configured parameters for simulation software, enabling efficient research and collaboration
