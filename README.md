# Open-PAV

Open-PAV (Open Production Automated Vehicle) is an open platform designed to facilitate **data collection, scenario generation, and evaluation** of production automated vehicle (PAV) behaviors. It integrates diverse datasets and calibrated vehicle models, making it an essential tool for researchers and developers aiming to study PAV dynamics and their impacts. The project encourages contributions from the research community and provides ready-to-use model parameters for seamless integration with simulation tools.

### Processed Data Source:

By organizing the data from the above datasets, we processed a unified trajectory dataset ULTra-AV, in which all data are represented using a standardized format. Available at -  [A unified longitudinal trajectory dataset for automated vehicle](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03795-y) and [ULTra-AV](https://github.com/CATS-Lab/Filed-Experiment-Data-ULTra-AV).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset:**
  - A comprehensive trajectory dataset has been compiled by seven research teams. This dataset encompasses trajectory data from 14 AV brands and 33 AV models, drawn from 13 open-source AV datasets. All data have been converted into a unified vectorized format to enable efficient access and analysis. 
  
- **Kinematic Model Calibration:**
  - Supports linear models, IDM models (for SUMO), Wiedemann-99 (for Vissim), and machine learning-based models.
  - Includes pre-configured model parameters for direct use in traditional simulation software.

- **Simulation Integration:**
  - Enables rapid and accurate simulation of automated vehicle behavior and analysis of their impacts.

- **Community Collaboration:**
  - Designed to foster contributions and collaboration among researchers globally.

## What's New

### March 2025
- **Model Enhancements:** Improved calibration modeling methodology.
- **Simulation Integration:** Configured packages for SUMO, Vissim, and basic parameters for models.

### December 2024
- **Dataset Expansion:** Added new open-source trajectory datasets from ULTra-AV datasets.
- **Model Enhancements:** Improved basic logic for the project.


## Major Components

Open-PAV consists of the following components:

- **Data Process:** Given the raw AV data (LiDAR, images, videos, trajectories) as input, this module converts data of the same type into a unified format and performs preliminary data cleaning.
- **System Identification:** Using the processed AV data, this module calibrates the vehicle kinematic models of automated vehicles and exports them for simulation use. Users can also directly input their AV software stack to test their developed AV system within this module.
- **Scenario Generation:** This module is designed to generate tailored safety-critical driving scenarios specific to a given AV model, aiming to evaluate its safety performance.
- **Evaluation:** The generated scenarios are fed into pre-configured simulators, such as SUMO, VISSIM, and CARLA, for more accurate safety evaluation.
